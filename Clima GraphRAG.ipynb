Key health outcomes observed include physical and mental health effects, such as increased incidences of heat exhaustion, dehydration, and heightened anxiety during prolonged heat periods.

The study also examines the socio-economic disparities influencing heat wave resilience among urban households, focusing on the impacts of income, education, occupation, and gender on adaptive capacity. . Low-income households are disproportionately affected, lacking adequate cooling resources and relying on less effective passive methods.

This study examines adaptation strategies among informal workers in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, in response to the increasing frequency of heat waves. Combining satellite data, meteorological records, and a field survey of 420 respondents, the research highlights significant challenges faced by this vulnerable population. Dhaka experienced 35 heat wave events from 2001 to 2022, with a peak of six events in 2021. Urban Heat Island (UHI) mapping revealed densely populated hotspots. While 42% of respondents live in pacca homes, few incorporate heat-resilient features like insulation or rooftop gardens. Though 99% have electricity, only 5.71% own backup power supplies, exacerbating vulnerability during power outages. Key adaptation practices include increased fluid intake (88.81%), opening windows (87.14%), and staying indoors (72.38%), though public cooling centers remain underutilized (15%). Analysis shows that education, socioeconomic status, and occupational type significantly influence adaptive practices. Indoor workers and individuals with higher education and income levels scored higher on adaptive measures.\n","\n","[REF_CTX_health_1] | SOURCE: https://openalex.org/W4405743105 | Urban household adaptation to extreme heatwaves: health impacts, socio-economic disparities and sustainable strategies in Rajshahi (2024)\n","Key excerpt: Concept: Health (health)\n","Paper Title: Urban household adaptation to extreme heatwaves: health impacts, socio-economic disparities and sustainable strategies in Rajshahi\n","Excerpt (2/2): commonly employed, but their effectiveness is often limited by socioeconomic factors.

Vulnerable Social Groups Most Severely Affected\n\nThe most severely affected populations are characterized by low socioeconomic status, occupational exposure, and systemic marginalization, particularly within urban environments characterized by the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect [REF_PRI_1], [GRAPH_1].\n\n| Vulnerable Social Group | Specific Vulnerability/Context | Supporting Evidence |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Low-Income Households & Populations in Poverty** | Disproportionately affected globally (Rajshahi, Portland) due to lacking adequate cooling resources and relying on ineffective passive methods [REF_PRI_1], [REF_PRI_4]. They are the primary recipients of health impact burdens [GRAPH_16]. | [REF_PRI_1], [REF_PRI_4], [GRAPH_16] |\n| **Outdoor Laborers & Informal Workers** | Highly exposed due to the nature of their work and limited occupational flexibility. This group faces heightened health risks, including heat exhaustion and dehydration [REF_PRI_1], [REF_PRI_3], [REF_CTX_health_2]. | [REF_PRI_1], [REF_PRI_3], [REF_CTX_vulnerable_population_1] |\n| **Non-White Populations** | Experience disproportionate exposure to extreme heat, reflecting an emerging environmental justice concern in developed urban settings (e.g., Portland, Oregon) [REF_PRI_4], [REF_PRI_5]. | [REF_PRI_4], [REF_PRI_5] |\n| **Marginalized Groups** | This category includes populations with inherently limited adaptive capacity. Health impacts (caused by heatwaves [GRAPH_23]) burden vulnerable groups generally [GRAPH_17], [GRAPH_18], specifically including the **elderly** [GRAPH_19] and **children** [GRAPH_20]. | [GRAPH_17], [GRAPH_18], [GRAPH_19], [GRAPH_20] |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Specific Socioeconomic and Systemic Exacerbating Factors\n\nVulnerability is fundamentally driven by a lack of resources, knowledge, and protective infrastructure that higher-income groups possess. These factors limit adaptive capacity and increase heat exposure:\n\n### A. Economic and Resource Deprivation\n*   **Lack of Cooling Resources:** Low-income households lack the financial means for adequate cooling resources (e.g., air conditioning) [REF_PRI_1]. In contrast, higher-income households have greater access to cooling refuge, such as residential central AC [REF_PRI_4].\n*   **Inadequate Infrastructure Resilience:** Many vulnerable households, even those in structural homes (*pacca homes*), lack essential heat-resilient features such as insulation or rooftop gardens. Furthermore, a lack of backup power supplies exacerbates vulnerability during necessary electrical outages [REF_CTX_vulnerable_population_1].\n*   **Limited Access to Refuge:** Groups in poverty lack access to necessary public cooling centers, either due to distance or utilization barriers [REF_PRI_4], [REF_CTX_vulnerable_population_1].\n\n### B. Occupational and Educational Barriers\n*   **Occupational Exposure Risk:** Individuals in outdoor and informal employment face limited control over their work environment (limited occupational flexibility), forcing them into high-exposure situations during peak heat [REF_PRI_1], [REF_PRI_3]. Indoor workers, conversely, demonstrate higher adaptive measures [REF_PRI_3].\n*   **Low Educational Attainment:** Education is a critical factor influencing adaptive capacity [REF_PRI_2]. Lower educational attainment is associated with reduced awareness of heat risks and less effective adoption of protective behaviors [REF_PRI_2].\n\n---\n\n## 3. Systemic Synthesis and Causal Chains (Systems Thinking)\n\nThe interaction between climate stressors (heat waves) and social structures creates a cycle of disproportionate exposure, demonstrating that socioeconomic disparities are exacerbated by extreme weather [REF_PRI_1].\n\n### Causal Chain: Poverty and Limited Adaptive Capacity\n\nExtreme Heatwaves (Climatic Stressor) [GRAPH_23] $\\rightarrow$ **UHI Effect** (Exacerbated Urban Stress) [REF_PRI_1], [GRAPH_25] $\\rightarrow$ Disproportionate Exposure to Heat [REF_PRI_4] $\\rightarrow$ Affects **Low-Income Households/Poverty** [GRAPH_16], [REF_PRI_1] $\\rightarrow$ **LACK OF CAPACITY** (no AC, poor housing, no cooling centers) [REF_PRI_4], [REF_CTX_vulnerable_population_1] $\\rightarrow$ Increased Health Impacts (heat exhaustion, dehydration, anxiety) [REF_PRI_1], [REF_CTX_health_2], [GRAPH_17].\n\n### Causal Chain: Occupation and Vulnerability\nInformal or Outdoor Occupation [REF_PRI_1], [REF_PRI_3] $\\rightarrow$ **Limited Occupational Flexibility** [REF_PRI_1] $\\rightarrow$ Inability to Modify Behavior (e.g., staying indoors) [REF_PRI_1], [REF_CTX_vulnerable_population_1] $\\rightarrow$ Heightened Physical Exposure and Socioeconomic Disparities [REF_PRI_1] $\\rightarrow$ Severe Health Risks [REF_PRI_1], [REF_CTX_health_2]."},"metadata":{}}],"source":["from google import genai\n","from google.colab import userdata\n","from IPython.display import Markdown, display\n","\n","# Configuración de la API Key\n","try:\n","    GOOGLE_API_KEY = userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')\n","    client = genai.Client(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)\n","    print(\"✅ Gemini Client Configured\")\n","except Exception as e:\n","    print(\"⚠️ Error: API Key not found.
